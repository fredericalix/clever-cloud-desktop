   - Add validation and bulk import/export
   - Implement save/cancel functionality

### üéØ High Priority (Week 2)
3. **Network Groups CRUD Operations**
   - Test create/delete with corrected endpoints
   - Implement member addition/removal
   - Add external peer management

4. **Code Architecture Cleanup**

   - Consolidate similar components
   - Add comprehensive testing framework

## Technical Debt

### üö® Critical Issues
- ~~Application crashes when changing organizations~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~Network Groups not detecting real data~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~Thread management causing RuntimeError~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority
- Multiple `WARNING | Request failed (attempt 1): Event loop is closed` in logs
- Font family "Monospace" missing warning
- Inconsistent error handling across components
- Add-ons 400 errors for some organizations

### üìù Low Priority
- Code duplication in widget initialization
- Missing type hints in some modules
- Incomplete docstring coverage

## Recent Achievements üéâ

### Network Groups Breakthrough (2025-01-16)
- **‚úÖ SOLVED**: Real Network Groups detection (`myNGDemo` found in "Fr√©d√©ric Alix")
